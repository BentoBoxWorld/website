# CheckMeOut
This is an island submission addon. This addon enables players to submit their island for consideration by admins. In this way, Admins can set up site-wide challenges or competitions that players can do and then submit their island for consideration. Admins get a GUI that lists submissions and they can teleport to the islands from there. Once an island is reviewed by admins it can be deleted, or when the whole activity is over, all submissions can be cleared.
